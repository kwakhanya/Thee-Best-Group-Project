# Chat Application

## Overview
This is a real-time chat application built using modern web technologies. It allows users to connect, chat, and exchange messages in real time. The application is powered by several modules and frameworks to provide a seamless and interactive chat experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase**: A cloud-based platform by Google for building web and mobile applications.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: A NoSQL cloud database for building real-time applications.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: A sentiment analysis library for understanding the sentiment of chat messages.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered React applications.

## Modules and Frameworks
### React
React is the foundation of our chat application's frontend. It helps us create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, allowing users to view and send messages in real time.

### Firebase
Firebase serves as the backend for our chat application. It provides user authentication and the Firebase Realtime Database for storing chat messages. Firebase allows us to handle real-time synchronization and user management seamlessly.

### Firebase Realtime Database
Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL database that stores chat messages. It ensures that messages are synchronized in real time across all connected clients, providing a smooth chat experience.

### Sentiment Analysis
We use the Sentiment Analysis library to analyze the sentiment of chat messages. This enables us to add emojis to messages to indicate the mood of the conversation. For example, happy emojis for positive messages and sad emojis for negative ones.

### Next.js
Next.js is a React framework that helps us build server-rendered React applications. It handles routing and server-side rendering, ensuring that our chat app is SEO-friendly and optimized for performance.

## How it Works
1. When users connect to the chat app, they are presented with an interface to enter their username.
2. Once users enter their usernames, they are taken to a chat room where they can see existing chat messages.
3. Users can type messages in the text box at the bottom and press Enter to send messages.
4. Messages are sent to Firebase Realtime Database, where they are stored and synchronized with other connected clients in real time.
5. Sentiment analysis is performed on the messages, and mood-based emojis are displayed next to each message to reflect the sentiment.
6. Messages are displayed in a conversation view, showing the sender's name, sentiment-based emojis, and the message content.
7. Users can engage in real-time conversations and enjoy a seamless chat experience.

That's an overview of the chat application, the technologies used, and how it works. Happy chatting!






This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
